The code solves typical problem of CFD, flow around the cube.

## Usage
Please create three empty folders named, q, velocity and pressure.
Make sure that all the file is in the same working directry.
The numerical result data will be written in these folders.

## Result
Here shows a post-pro image that can be obtained from this simulation.
